CSA Unit 2 Project Hangman Game Java

Editors: Erika Tran and Kellie Tai

This is a hangman game in Java. In our project, we are comparing the same game in Python using Pygame and in Java using Java Swing. We wanted to compare and explore two different libraries in two different coding languages. We wanted to focus on the advantages and disadvantages each language and library has. In our game, it asks the user to guess the letters in a given word. If the letter is in the word, then the letter will be displayed in the correct spot. If it is incorrect, then it will let the user know that the letter is not in the word. Once the complete word has been guessed, it will print the final word that they have guessed.
